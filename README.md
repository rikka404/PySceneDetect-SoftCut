# PySceneDetect-SoftCut

This project is a modified version of [PySceneDetect](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect), with a focus on improving scene detection performance for **soft cuts** (e.g., dissolves, fades).

## Purpose

The goal of this fork is to add functionality to better detect gradual scene transitions which are not easily captured by threshold-based hard cut detection.
